# Admin Interface Implementation

## Overview

The Cloudscape-based admin interface has been successfully implemented for NeoHarbour Security system management. This interface provides comprehensive administrative capabilities using AWS Cloudscape Design System components.

## Components Implemented

### 1. AdminDashboard (`src/components/AdminDashboard.tsx`)
- Main admin dashboard with tabbed interface
- Overview tab with system status and quick actions
- Integrates all admin sub-components
- Role-based access control using `PERMISSIONS.CONFIGURE_SYSTEM`

### 2. SystemConfiguration (`src/components/SystemConfiguration.tsx`)
- **General Settings**: System name, environment, debug mode, log level, max concurrent investigations
- **Demo Configuration**: Demo mode settings, default scenarios, session limits
- **Security Settings**: Session timeout, MFA requirements, domain restrictions, IP whitelist
- **Notification Settings**: Email, Slack, and webhook configurations
- Form validation and error handling
- Real-time configuration testing

### 3. AWSServiceConfig (`src/components/AWSServiceConfig.tsx`)
- AWS credentials configuration (Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Region)
- Service-specific configuration:
  - DynamoDB tables (investigations, metrics)
  - S3 buckets (artifacts, audit)
  - Bedrock models (Claude 3 Haiku, Sonnet, etc.)
  - Step Functions state machines
  - EventBridge event buses
  - Lambda function prefixes
- AWS service health monitoring and testing
- IAM policy generation for required permissions
- Connection validation and troubleshooting

### 4. SystemMonitoring (`src/components/SystemMonitoring.tsx`)
- **Overview Tab**: System health status, service health checks
- **Metrics Tab**: Performance charts (CPU, memory, investigations)
- **Logs Tab**: System logs with filtering by level and time range
- Real-time data refresh (30s for metrics, 10s for logs)
- Export functionality for logs and reports

### 5. Enhanced AdminUserManagement (`src/components/AdminUserManagement.tsx`)
- User listing with role management
- Role assignment (Admin, Analyst, Viewer, Demo User)
- User ban/unban functionality
- Permission-based access control

## Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- Integrated with Clerk authentication system
- Role-based permissions using `useAuth` hook
- Protected routes with `RequirePermission` component
- Permissions include:
  - `CONFIGURE_SYSTEM`: Access to system configuration
  - `MANAGE_AWS_CONFIG`: AWS service configuration
  - `MANAGE_USERS`: User management capabilities
  - `VIEW_SYSTEM_HEALTH`: System monitoring access

### AWS Integration
- Real AWS service connectivity testing
- Secure credential storage and validation
- Service health monitoring for:
  - DynamoDB
  - S3
  - Bedrock
  - Step Functions
  - EventBridge
  - Lambda
- Automated IAM policy generation

### User Experience
- AWS Cloudscape Design System components
- Consistent styling with AWS Console
- Dark/light theme support
- Responsive design
- Real-time status indicators
- Form validation and error handling
- Loading states and progress indicators

### Security Features
- Encrypted credential storage
- Input validation and sanitization
- Role-based access control
- Session management
- Audit logging capabilities

## Navigation Integration

The admin interface is integrated into the main application navigation:
- **Administration** menu item for users with admin permissions
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Active tab highlighting
- Consistent header and layout

## API Integration

All components use the authenticated API client (`useApiClient`) for:
- Configuration management (`/admin/config`)
- AWS service management (`/admin/aws/*`)
- User management (`/admin/users`)
- System monitoring (`/admin/metrics`, `/admin/logs`, `/admin/health`)

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **8.1**: Admin dashboard using AWS Cloudscape Design System components
✅ **8.2**: User management interface with role assignment and permission controls  
✅ **8.3**: System configuration panels for AWS service setup and validation
✅ **9.1**: AWS service connection testing and validation utilities
✅ **9.3**: Environment management tools with configuration validation

## Usage

1. **Access**: Users with `CONFIGURE_SYSTEM` or `MANAGE_USERS` permissions can access the admin interface
2. **Navigation**: Click "Administration" in the main navigation menu
3. **Tabs**: Use the tabbed interface to navigate between different admin functions
4. **Configuration**: Update system settings, AWS credentials, and user permissions
5. **Monitoring**: View real-time system health, metrics, and logs

## Future Enhancements

- Advanced monitoring dashboards
- Automated backup and restore
- Compliance reporting integration
- Advanced user analytics
- System performance optimization tools
